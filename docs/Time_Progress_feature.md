we want to implement the following

a progress bar that change how the time passes

we will have it in the center middle of the screen

it will be a curved progress bar 
the progress bar will have controllers to make time faster or smaller or stop and will have time (year and month indicators (no hour or smaller))

it will be for changing the time passing speed

when time is faster the orbit acceleration and acceleration will be faster for both planets and moons

user can change time speed by dragging the curved progress bar or by pressing the controllers which appears when hover

first increasing will be in days then it will turn into weeks then into months

we should make sure that everything is synced (timing and planets rotation)

so when one year passes we are sure that planet earth rotated one round around the sun

and when the time is faster all objects got reflected

i will provide you with images about the expected look of the progress bar controller which will be in the middle center

you can use the dat.gui package
