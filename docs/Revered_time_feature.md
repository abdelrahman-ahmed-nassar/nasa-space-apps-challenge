we want to have a go to past feature

first the progress par will now have double the ranges
+ one extra in the middle we will cal (REAL RATE which will be like 0.1 day per second)

one for increasing the time and one for decreasing the time


and at start the pointer will be in the middle
the glow line will start from the middle to where the pointer is

when the time is revered planets and moons should go reversed in the other direction
also planet orbit around themselves should reverse

now indicators should have + or - to indicate it

the on hover controllers now should also handle the decrease in time



also the timing indicator should reflect and keep synced
